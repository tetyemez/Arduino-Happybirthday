# Arduino-Happybirthday
Arduino project for a birth suprise. Candle and LM35 sensor are adjacent. When temperature higher than 40 centigrate led's are on and lcd writes "Could you blow the candle?" when temperature is lower than 40 centigrate led's are off (like they on when candle is on fire), lcd writes "Happy Birthday XXX" and speaker sounds like happy birthday song. 
This is a cool birthday suprise.
